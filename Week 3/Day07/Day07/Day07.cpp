        FIELDS - the data of the class

        METHODS - the behavior of the class (what the class can do)

        SPECIAL METHODS:
            Getters/Setters - the gatekeepers of the fields
            CONSTRUCTORS - the initializer of the class
            DESTRUCTORS - destroys allocated memory.

        non-static methods can access the fields/methods of the class
        static methods can only access the static members of the class

        EXAMPLE:
        void whoAmI()
        {
            std::cout << mName;
        }

        1) cannot have any return type, not even void
        2) must have the same name as the class

        HINT: use the ctor code snippet to provide a default contructor

        {
           mModelYear = year;
