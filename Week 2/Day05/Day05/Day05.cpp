        There are 2 ways to search a vector: linear search or binary search

        CHALLENGE 1:

            write a method to linear search the numbers list.
                The method should take 2 parameters: vector of ints to search, int to search for.
                The method should return -1 if NOT found or the index if found.

            The algorithm:
                1) start at the beginning of the vector
                2) compare each item in the vector to the search item
                3) if found, return the index
                4) if reach the end of the vector, return -1 which means not found

        map<TKey, TValue>  - an associative collection.

            1) replace TKey with whatever type of data you want to use for the keys
